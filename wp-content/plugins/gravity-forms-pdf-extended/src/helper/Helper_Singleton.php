/**
 * A Sudo-Singleton Helper Class designed to hold our MVC classes
 * The main benefit is it more easily allows users to remove filters/actions Gravity PDF sets
 *
 * This isn't considered an actual `Singleton` pattern as we're not modifying our classes in any way (no static methods / disabling of the __construct), but it has the same objectives
